# Flag'D

Flag’D is a web app that teaches Generation Alpha how to keep their personal information safe from social engineering attacks by learning to recognize and respond to online red flags through interactive, relatable simulations. The app uses short videos and activities inspired by social media trends, like TikTok and Instagram, to help students identify “red flags” online and understand how their personal information can be exploited. 

I chose to make Flag’D a web app because it is accessible on any device. Not all tweens have phones, but most have access to a laptop or tablet for school or home use. 

Flag’D 1.0 (the current and first version) starts with a welcome video that introduces the mission of the app and defines social engineering as “when someone lies or tricks to get people to share private information or do something they shouldn’t.” After familiarizing themselves with the concept, users move to the Flag Lab, where they can complete an interactive simulation focused on phishing, one of the most common and recognizable forms of social engineering. 

Each simulation presents real-world scenarios that mimic online interactions tweens might actually encounter. The phishing activity begins with a short, animated scene that introduces the situation, followed by an interactive challenge where users must clear their inbox by spotting red flags in suspicious messages. 

What makes Flag’D unique is that it shows both the user’s and the hacker’s point of view. This helps kids understand why hackers do what they do and how even small actions can lead to major security risks. By seeing both sides, students gain a deeper understanding of how their information can be exploited, not through fear, but through awareness. 

The goal of Flag’D is simple: to make cybersecurity education engaging, accessible, and age-appropriate for Generation Alpha. By connecting cybersecurity to their everyday digital habits, Flag’D helps them build habits of caution and critical thinking online while making learning about safety fun and relatable.
